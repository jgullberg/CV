  <h3>Bio</h3>
  <p>
    I am industrious and entrepreneurial but highly value collaboration and team work. I am never satisfied with the status quo and believe in data-driven results while paying attention to every detail. I am a risk-taker and remain persistent to
    achieve results with a hard work ethic.</p>
  </p>I am from Racine, Wisconsin and enjoy spending time with family and friends especially while watching the Green Bay Packers, Milwaukee Bucks, and Wisconsin Badgers. A perfect day for me would be exploring a new city while observing all the
  different lifestyles people live. Just remember, ice cream (especially chocolate) makes everything better.</p>
